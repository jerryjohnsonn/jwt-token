How to interact with this JWT Code?

- First of all please do : npm install to download all dependencies needed here
- Make sure to create a .env file , along with creating 2 variables , ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET and REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET , and then you may fill the variable with the random string or random password
  For example in my case, I used:
  REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=16a58435b8d10c6541a1ce0892838d48a28a27b1f4a546437f9da5b796bbc0a1117adebbd40a63547b6ba4847b0ec and don't' forget about the ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET as well.

I guess after that , your JWT Token can be used.

If you are interested to learn more about JWT Token , I guess you should check out some Youtube channel, it provides a lot of videos about JWT.

Thankyou
